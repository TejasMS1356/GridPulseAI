⚡ GridPulse AI

GridPulse AI is an AI-powered smart grid monitoring and optimization system built for modern Smart Cities. It uses machine learning and time-series models to analyze electricity consumption patterns, forecast future demand, detect abnormal usage, and prevent transformer overloads before failures occur.


🚩 Problem

Power distribution networks often rely on reactive monitoring, which leads to inaccurate demand forecasting, unexpected transformer failures, and undetected electricity theft. These issues cause frequent outages, infrastructure stress, and significant financial losses for electricity providers.


💡 Solution

GridPulse AI brings intelligence and prediction into grid operations by providing:

🔮 Accurate electricity demand forecasting using LSTM time-series models

⚠️ Transformer overload risk prediction using XGBoost machine learning

🚨 Anomaly detection using Isolation Forest to identify abnormal consumption patterns

📊 Real-time monitoring dashboard for clear visualization and faster decision-making

This enables utilities to shift from reactive maintenance to proactive, data-driven grid management.


🛠 Tech Stack

Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LSTM, Flask, MySQL, and Streamlit are used to build a scalable, intelligent, and production-ready system.


🏙 Smart City Impact

Enables intelligent and efficient energy management

Detects faults and overload risks early

Reduces financial losses and improves grid reliability

Supports scalable integration with future smart city infrastructure
